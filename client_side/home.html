                <h2>Great Coharie River Initiative</h2>
                <p>
                    The Coharie Indian tribe is located in North Carolina in Harnett and Sampson Counties. These counties lie in the Southeastern part of the state and are majority rural counties. Much of the land is used for agriculture. The Coharie Tribe is not one of the largest Native American Tribes, but rather a smaller tight-knit community who share common histories and cultures. One entity that all Coharie have a common history from is the Great Coharie River. Many of the Coharie have lived next to and around this river, using it as a source of food, recreation, and culture. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recent years, however, the river's ecology has been changing. Due to the introduction of the beaver, an invasive species in the area, and several storms over the years, dams and debris have been blocking and slowing the flow of the river. The result is the formation of swampy wetland area in certain parts down the Coharie River. To remedy this, members from the Coharie Tribe, using a grant, volunteered their time and energy to clean up the river. Still working at it, these tribe members hope to have the river running like it did when they were younger.

                <p>
                    In addition to the cleaning of the river, the River Initiative includes a project trying to increase community involvement and education, while gaining easier access to the river. These goals require access to a 64-acre parcel of land owned by North Carolina. The Coharie Tribe has been working with the Wildlife Resource Commission and the State Government to try to learn more about the parcel and if they could lease the land or be given permission to use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this parcel, the Coharie wish to have a cultural education center. Here, community members can learn about traditional Native American structures, local vegetation, and kayaking. Signing up for sessions can be done by going to the event sign up page in the navigation menu. There is also a forum where people can discuss local history of the Coharie and learn more through communication.
